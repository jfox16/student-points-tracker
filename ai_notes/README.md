# AI Documentation

This directory serves as an AI-optimized knowledge base for the Student Points Tracker project. It's designed to help AI agents understand and work with the codebase more effectively while remaining human-readable.

## Structure

- `/concepts` - Core concepts and domain knowledge
- `/architecture` - System architecture and technical decisions
- `/decisions` - Project decisions and their rationale

## Purpose

This directory acts as an encyclopedia for the project, containing:
- Important concepts and their relationships
- Architectural decisions and patterns
- Project-specific terminology
- AI agent notes and observations
- Reference points for different parts of the application

## Usage

### For AI Agents
- Use this directory as the primary source of project knowledge
- Reference relevant files when making changes or suggestions
- Add notes when discovering useful patterns or concepts
- Update existing documentation when making significant changes

### For Humans
- Use as a reference for understanding the project
- Maintain documentation when making architectural changes
- Add context to complex decisions
- Track project evolution

## Maintenance

1. Keep documentation up to date with code changes
2. Add new concepts as they emerge
3. Document architectural decisions when made
4. Include examples where helpful
5. Cross-reference related concepts
6. Add timestamps to significant updates

## File Naming Convention

- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Include category prefix (e.g., `concept-`, `arch-`, `decision-`)
- Add date suffix for versioned documents (e.g., `-2024-04-01`)
