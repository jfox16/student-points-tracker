Originally created for a teacher friend, this tool offers a simple and engaging way to reward students with participation points during class.

It uses intuitive keyboard shortcutsâ€”each student gets a key, and the spacebar gives points to all. Fun animations and sounds make the experience more rewarding for students.

Points are saved automatically via local storage, so progress persists across sessions.
