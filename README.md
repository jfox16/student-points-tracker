Originally built for a teacher friend who wanted a simple and engaging way to reward students with points during class.

This tool makes tracking student points easy with intuitive keyboard shortcutsâ€”each student has an assigned key, and the spacebar allows awarding points to all students at once. Animations and sounds enhance the experience, making it more fun and rewarding for students.

To ensure progress is saved across sessions, the app automatically stores data in local storage, allowing teachers to track points throughout the week.

It's free to use for teachers, professors, or anything non-profit! You can try it here: https://jfox16.github.io/student-points-tracker/
