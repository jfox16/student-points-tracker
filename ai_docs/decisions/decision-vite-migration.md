# Vite Migration Decision

## Context
The project was originally created using Create React App (CRA) with react-scripts. As the project grew, we experienced slower development server startup times and build times.

## Decision
Migrate from react-scripts to Vite for improved development experience and build performance.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Keep react-scripts**
   - Pros: No migration effort required
   - Cons: Continued slow development experience, limited future improvements

2. **Next.js**
   - Pros: Full-featured framework, great SSR support
   - Cons: Overkill for our needs, would require significant restructuring

3. **Vite**
   - Pros: 
     - Fast development server startup
     - Instant HMR
     - Modern tooling
     - Simple configuration
     - Great TypeScript support
   - Cons:
     - Migration effort required
     - Need to update build scripts

## Implementation Details
- Removed react-scripts dependency
- Added Vite and @vitejs/plugin-react
- Created vite.config.ts with necessary configuration
- Updated package.json scripts
- Moved index.html to root directory
- Added Vitest for testing

## Impact
- Faster development server startup
- Improved build performance
- Better TypeScript integration
- Modern development experience
- Simplified configuration

## AI Notes
- Consider adding Vite-specific optimizations in the future
- Monitor build performance metrics
- Keep an eye on Vite updates for new features
- Document any Vite-specific patterns that emerge
