## Technical Implementation

### Role Definition

enum UserRole {
  TEACHER = 'TEACHER',
  STUDENT = 'STUDENT',
  TA = 'TA'
}

interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  role: UserRole;
  classId: string;
  permissions: Permission[];
}
```

### Permission System
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
